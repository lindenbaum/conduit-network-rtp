-- | Class of numbers that are monotone increasing (or decreasing) and have a
-- relative order, that is not necessarily transitive.
--
-- For example, for a series of 'Word8' values: @0 64 128 192 0 64 128 ...@
-- could be interpreted as a monotone series of consecutive increasing values,
-- that wrap around after 255. But note that the 'Ord' instance is not
-- sufficient to express that @0@ is __after__ @192@, since @0 < 192@.
